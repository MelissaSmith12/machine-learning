    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

I transferred information from my notes and the sklearn documentation in a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15_KhGqlTocNUxL0MnJpmN_4oDQBAU7w6LSyfEXpiIkc/edit#gid=1839286387). The sklearn documentation provided an excellent overview of strengths and weaknesses, except for ensemble methods. I used an additional resource that also included a comprehensive [comparison chart](http://www.designemergente.org/common-supervised-learning-models-pros-and-cons/). Links to other specific documentation are included in the spreadsheet. Generally speaking, I have not modified the wording from the original source.\n",

    "- **Decision trees**: because there are more than 100 features associated with this data after we transformed it, it seemed like any decision tree created us the data would be especially prone to overfitting, particularly because we have a high volume of categorical data.\n",
    "- **K - nearest Neighbors, SVM**: both of these models struggle when n is very large. In running some preliminary tests, I discovered that these models had very slow training times, and I would be concerned that these models would be exceptionally slow during prediction, since we need to be able to predict based on a data set of 15 million Californians.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data that we have, the models that were ideally looking for will be able to handle sparse data. Because we have used one hot encoding on the categorical data it is not necessary that we restrict ourselves to models that are only used on numerical data (e.g. logistic regression). Given the high number of features, we will also want to favour models that include protections against overfitting by design (e.g. ensemble methods). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the project has us walkthrough one-hot encoding on the categorical data, this makes me inclined to include a model for which such a transformation would be necessary.

So both Adaboost and Gradient Boost will be excellent candidates to tackle this dataset. A concern with implementing Adaboost is its weakness to outliers. By applying logarithmic transformations and normalization, we have controlled our outliers. Hopefully they have been adequately tamed.\n",

    "- weaknesses: requires much more data to achieve stable, meaningful results: at least 50 data points per predictor is necessary to achieve stable results, can't handle categorical data, high bias, must assume the features are roughly linear and the problem is linearly separable.\n",
    "- good candidate: Primarily I'm including this data set because I'd like to try a non-ensemble method for comparison, and this is the best suited for the data, after the application of one-hot encoding (since it cannot handle categorical data). One concern I have about the model is the weakness that it needs at least 50 data points per predictor to achieve stable results.

    "Based on our training and testing, the model that we'll be using to identify individuals making more than $50,000 is the GradientBoost model. This model does have the longest training time of the models we tested, however it still completes training in under 20 seconds and performs very well when making predictions. Prediction time will be significant since we're applying the model to the entire adult population of California. This model is well suited for the data because it optimizes the predictive power of the underlying decision tree or logistic regression model used to create weak learners without overfitting. We can see that the model doesn't overfit because the test data accuracy is over 80% and our f-score is approximately 75%."

    "A gradient boost model takes a subset of the data and creates what's called a weak learner off using that data. The goal of this weak learner isn't to perfectly predict the data, it's just to come up with a prediction. Then Gradient Boost figures out where that weak learner predicted incorrectly and builds another model that can predict those points correctly. It does this process iteratively until all of these weak learners accumulate into what we call a strong learner, attempting to minimize error with every iteration.\n",

    "- the testing data, which is the remaining 25% of the data\n",
    "We used the training set as the model iterated through, accumulating weak learnings and minimizing errors. Once the model is trained, we use the testing data. The model hasn't seen the particular combinations of variables in the testing set, but we still know what the outcome should be on this data. So we use it to forecast how well our model will predict any new data that it sees. \n",

Since we've used a beta of 0.5, we're favoring precision over recall - it's more important that the letters we send out to potential donors are to individuals making over 50K than it is to know that we're sending letters to all individuals who make over 50K. Our F-0.5 score for our optimized model is almost 75% while it was only 29% for the naive model."

    "**Education - level**\n",
    "Higher years of education generally correlate with higher salary levels. For example, individuals who complete a college degree (typically 16 years of schooling) tend to make more money than individuals who have completed high school or less. This isn't always the case because of the variation across occupations, which is why it is ranked lower than occupation. For example you might have two individuals who completed 16 years of schooling,  but one of them is a social worker and the other is an engineer. You would expect significant variation in salaries between those two individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Age**\n",
    "Generally speaking as workers grow older they acquire more skills and experience in their field which translates into higher wages. This isn't true across the board however. Industries with out a significant amount of specialized knowledge might be tend to be more low-paying occupations and we wouldn't expect to see pay rates significantly increase as individuals with those occupations age. Additionally, once individuals reach retirement age, I would expect age to correspond to lower earnings.\n"

    "This visualization indicates that my prediction was close to correct. The order of the variables are different, but my estimate agrees with the most important variable: capital-gain. Where I had predicted occupation, the data reveals that marital status is more important. This makes me wonder if we're looking at the household income instead of individual income, since people across all income levels are married. The order within the last four variables is different than I had predicted, however the green bar on the graph is not visibly different for variables 2-4. Other than the marital-status, this visualization more or less confirms my intiutive understanding of the variables. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

In the case of this model, training time was quite low, but if we were training again using a significantly larger data set, then I would consider using a reduced data set. It's particularly worth considering because as we're applying the model, we'll be predicting against millions of California residents, so using a smaller feature set could provide significant performance improvements for predictions.\n",
